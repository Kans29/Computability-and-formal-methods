# Computability-and-formal-methods


This is a C++ code, the general idea was to work with Context free gramars and their way to change intro Compsky and greibach forms.

At first, it ask you to write a CFG or load some from a txt, then, it converts it to Chompsky and greibach form.

Later, it gives you the option to generate a random sequence with the grammar.

Finishing, it ask you to input a sequence and it determines wheter it can be generated by the CFG or not.

Done for learning purposes.
